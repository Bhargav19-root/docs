# API Best Practices

Recommendations for robust integrations.

## Authentication

- Use `Authorization: Bearer ez_<token>`
- Store tokens securely and rotate regularly
- Do not embed tokens in client-side code

## Rate Limits

- Respect `429 Too Many Requests` responses
- Implement exponential backoff and retries for transient failures
- Cache non-mutating responses where appropriate

## Reliability

- Use timeouts and circuit breakers
- Retry `5xx` and network errors with jitter
- Log requests and responses (excluding secrets)

## Security

- Use HTTPS only
- Avoid logging raw tokens
- Use per-environment tokens with least privilege
