<Tip>
Before creating templates, agree on your team's naming convention. The [UTM naming convention](/playbooks/utm-naming-convention) playbook defines the approved source, medium, and campaign values your templates should use.
</Tip>

## What it is

A UTM template is a saved set of UTM values (source, medium, campaign, term, content) you can apply with one click in the link builder. Workspace-scoped. Track how often each is used.

## When to use it

- Same channel, repeat campaigns: weekly newsletter, monthly Google Ads, recurring event.
- Multi-person team - without templates, three marketers will spell `Newsletter`/`newsletter`/`news_letter` differently.
- Big launches with 20+ links per channel.

If you only build a one-off link a quarter, skip templates. Use [UTM Rules](/utm-rules/overview) instead - they apply automatically to all links.

## How it works

A template stores the raw UTM values. When applied during link creation, they pre-fill the form. You can override any field before saving.

The system tracks `usageCount` per template - see [Manage templates](/utm-templates/manage-templates) for the most-used view.

## Real-world example

A SaaS company runs:

| Template            | source       | medium        | campaign         |
| ------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Newsletter Weekly   | `newsletter` | `email`       | `weekly-digest`  |
| Google Brand Search | `google`     | `cpc`         | `brand-search`   |
| Meta Retargeting    | `facebook`   | `paid-social` | `retargeting-v2` |
| LinkedIn Webinar    | `linkedin`   | `paid-social` | `webinar-q2`     |

Marketer building this week's newsletter link: pick **Newsletter Weekly** template → fill destination URL + content (`hero_cta`) → done in 5 seconds.

## Common mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="One template per link">
    Templates are for shape, not specific links. Make `Newsletter Weekly`, not `Newsletter Week 19 May 5`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hard-coding utm_content in template">
    `utm_content` differentiates within a template. Leave it blank in the template; fill per-link. Otherwise every link inherits the same content value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Templates as the only standard">
    Templates are opt-in - a user can skip them. If consistency matters across the team, pair templates with [UTM Rules](/utm-rules/overview) which enforce standards automatically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Edge cases

<Note>
**Template limit.** Each workspace has a maximum number of templates. Reached the limit? Deactivate or delete unused ones - see [Manage templates](/utm-templates/manage-templates).
</Note>

<Note>
**Inactive templates** stay in the system but rank below active ones in the picker.
</Note>

<Note>
**Template values still pass through UTM Rules** on link save. A template with `utm_source=Newsletter` becomes `newsletter` if force-lowercase is on.
</Note>
