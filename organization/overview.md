# Organization, Workspaces & Projects Overview

Learn how LinkUTM's organizational structure helps you manage campaigns, teams, and clients efficiently.

## Understanding the Hierarchy

LinkUTM uses a three-tier organizational structure to help you organize your work:

```
Organization (Account Level)
    ↓

Project (Campaign/Client Level)
    ↓
Links (Individual Tracking Links)
```

### The Three Levels

- Centralized user management

**Workspace (Middle Level)**

- Team member management
- Shared resources and settings
- Separate billing per workspace (if applicable)
